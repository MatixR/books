Program for the solution of quasi 1-D Euler equations Eq. (12.4) on structured
grids. Spatial discretization is conducted either by the central scheme with
scalar artificial dissipation, by Roe's upwind scheme, or by the CUSP scheme.
Further details are provided in Section 12.5 of the book.

  Files
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Makefile   - compilation options
README.txt - what you read now
param.inc  - include file
*.f        - source files ("main.f" contains the main program)

There are the following files in the directory "../run":

conver_c.v2d - convergence history (central scheme)
conver_r.v2d - convergence history (Roe scheme)
conver_u.v2d - convergence history (CUSP scheme)
eul1d.exe    - executable for Windows 64-bit platform
input_c      - input parameters (example for the central scheme)
input_r      - input parameters (example for Roe's upwind scheme)
input_u      - input parameters (example for the CUSP scheme)
laval.grd    - grid file
plot_c.pdf   - PDF file with results (central scheme)
plot_r.pdf   - PDF file with results (Roe scheme)
plot_u.pdf   - PDF file with results (CUSP scheme)
plot_c.v2d   - plot file (central scheme)
plot_r.v2d   - plot file (Roe scheme)
plot_u.v2d   - plot file (CUSP scheme)

The files "plot_.v2d", and "conver_" were generated using the corresponding
"input_" files. The grid file "laval.grd" was obtained by running "laval" in
the directory "grid1_d".


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  How to compile "eul1d"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edit first the flags (SRC, EXEC, O, RM, LD, FC, FFLAGS, and LDFLAGS) in
"Makefile" as appropriate for your computer, compiler and/or operating system.
There are examples of settings for GNU gfortran, Mac OS X, IBM, SGI and SUN f77
compilers. Type "make" at the prompt to compile the program. All object files
and the executable can be deleted by "make clean".


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  How to run "eul1d"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program reads a number of user parameters from the standard input. The user
parameters are stored in a plain ASCII file. Examples are provided in the files
"input_...". In order to run "eul1d", you have to type at the prompt:

% eul1d < [input file]

where [input file] is the path and name of the file with parameters, e.g.:

% eul1d < input_c

The program reads in a grid file (laval.grd in the examples) previously
generated by the program "laval" from the directory "grid_1d". "eul1d"
outputs three files - convergence history, plot data and a restart file (in
binary format). In the example input file "input_c" they are named as
"conver_c.v2d", "plot_c.v2d" and rest_c", respectively.

The file with the convergence history contains the quantities:

iteration  - iteration number
log(resid) - log10 of density based convergence measure (see Eq. (12.1))
drho_max   - maximum difference between new and old density [kg/m^3]
node       - grid node where drmax is found
mass flow  - average mass flow rate [kg/s]
mass diff  - difference between mass flow at inlet and outlet [kg/s]
nsup pts   - number of supersonic points.

The plot file contains the variables:

x         - x-coordinate [m]
A         - nozzle area [m^2]
rho       - density [kg/m^3]
u         - velocity [m/s]
p         - static pressure [Pa]
T         - static temperature [K]
Mach      - local Mach number
mass flow - local mass flow rate [kg/s].

The data in the convergence and the plot file are stored in Vis2D format and
can be visualized using the plotting software available at www.cfd-ca.de.
Please note that all physical quantities are defined in SI units.
