CAFFA-MG: Multigrid Version of the CAFFA-code
=============================================

The CAFFAC.F version of the code (see directory "sg") was extended
by implementing the multigrid acceleration for the outer iterations
(multigrid acceleration for inner iterations does not bring much;
it would only make sense for the pressure-correction equation and
would reduce the computing time by at most a factor of 2; see directory
"solvers" for a multigrid version of SIP, which could be directly
implemented in CAFFA-codes instead of single-grid SIP solver).
The method is described in Chap. 11, Sect. 11.1; a detailed description
can also be found in a paper:

Lilek, Z., Muzaferija, S., Peric, M.: Efficiency and accuracy 
aspects of a full-multigrid SIMPLE algorithm for three-dimensional
flows, Numer. Heat Transfer, Part B, Vol. 31, pp. 23--42 (1997).

The program includes a lot of comments which describe all the 
extensions; users familiar with the single-grid version and after
reading Sect. 11.1 will have no problems in following the steps.

In the directory "examples" there are several test cases set up for
the multigrid computations: 'cav45l' (lid-driven cavity with inclined
walls at 45 deg.), 'cav90l' (lid-driven square cavity), 'hotcol'
(square cavity with one wall hot and the other cold), 'chanel'
(complex channel with a strongly non-orthogonal grid), 'concil' 
(buoyancy-driven flow between concentric cylinders, inner hot and
outer cold; only one half computed), etc. The parameters
used in these test calculations have not been optimized (number
of iterations on each grid level, under-relaxation factors etc.).
The speed-up compared with the single-grid version is remarkable.

Note that for unsteady problems one usually needs only few outer
iterations per time step, so multigrid acceleration does not lead
to a significant reduction of computing time. Steady, elliptic
problems may be speeded-up by as much as 100 times (at sixth level)!

I guess that an additional modification is needed in the code for
O- and C-grids (such test problems have not been tried so far); the
new version will replace this one after the correction is applied.

I appreciate the help provided by Martin Schmid (who found and
corrected most of the bugs I made in programming the code extensions)
and Samir Muzaferija (who helped find the most difficult ones).
