The following files are presently included in this directory:

GRID.F      This file contains a code for generating 3D Cartesian multigrid
            grids. Its main part is the 2D grid generation code described
            in more detail in directory 2DC. In addition, it is also used
            to set boundary conditions, since the type of boundary for
            CV-faces along boundaries can be prescribed by assigning a
            particular value to an integer array identifying each boundary
            cell face. More details will be given for the updated version.

DG          An example of input data for the above code; it generates a
            non-uniform grid for a cubic cavity as used to predict flows in
            lid-driven cavities.

PROG.F      This file contains the code for solving the steady three-dimensional
            Navier-Stokes equations using Cartesian grids and colocated
            arrangement of variables. Multigrid FAS scheme is used to
            accelerate outer iterations. It is set to calculate lid-driven 
            cavity flows and was used to produce results published by
            Lilek, Muzaferija and Peric in Numer. Heat Transfer, Part B
            ("Efficiency and Accuracy Aspects of a Full-Multigrid 
            SIMPLE-Algorithm for Three-Dimensional Flows").

DC          An example of input data for the above code (set for lid-driven
            cavity flow at Re = 1000).



REMARK:  We have assumed that all variables will be initialized by
         compiler with zero values; problems may be encountered if the
         variables are initialized as "undefined", since some variable
         values are used before they are re-initialized (and it is
         assumed that these values are equal to zero). The codes were
         run on several Unix workstations, under Linux and under DOS using
         various compilers without problems, but one reader reported
         problems...
