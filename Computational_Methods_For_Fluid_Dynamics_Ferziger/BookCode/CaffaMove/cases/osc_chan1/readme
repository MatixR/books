 This directory contains data for computation of the flow in a channel 
 with a moving indentetion.
 
 All relevant parameters are choosen as in paper by Demirdzic and Peric:

 Finite volume method for prediction of fluid flow in arbitrarily shaped
 domains with moving boundaries. International journal for numerical methods
 in fluids, vol. 10, pp. 771-790 (1990).
