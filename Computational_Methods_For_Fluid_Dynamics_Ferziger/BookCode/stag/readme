This directory contains the code for solving Navier-Stokes equations
using Cartesian grids and staggered arrangement of variables. The 
following files are in this directory:

GRID.F    Grid generation code for Cartesian grids. It is identical to
          the code GRID.F in directory 2DC for colocated grids. Here no
          multigrid version of the flow solver is available (colocated
          arrangement is nice especially because the implementation of
          multigrid is easy, as only one set of CVs is present), so one
          should generate only a single grid.

GRID.INP  An example of input data for the above code.

PSTAG.F   Flow solver using Cartesian grids and staggered arrangement of
          variables. Velocity U is displaced to the east, V to the north
          face of continuity CVs. See Sect. 7.5.1 for details on the
          algorithm. There are many comments in the code which make it
          easy to recognize the elements of the algorithm. Only steady
          version; it is easy to implement time integration following the
          strategy from PCOL.F (time integration does not depend on 
          variable arrangement). Upwind or central differencing can be
          chosen for convective terms. The code is set for a lid-driven
          cavity flow; it could be a good excercise for a student to
          adapt it to a flow with inlet and outlet...

PSTAG.INP An example of input data for the above code.

PLOT.F    The code which produces vector, profile, contour, and colour fill
          plots of results. It is the same code that is used for colocated
          Cartesian (directory 2DC) and non-orthogonal (directory 2DG)
          grids.

PLOT.INP  An example of input data for the above code.
