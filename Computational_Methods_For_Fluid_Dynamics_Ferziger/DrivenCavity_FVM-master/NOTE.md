Excerpt of email I received from the author

The code is based on one developed by M. Peric 1998 and described by
Ferziger and Peric´ [J.H. Ferziger, M. Peric´ , Computational Methods
for Fluid Dynamics, third, rev. ed., Springer, Berlin; New York,
2002.]  It was ported from FORTRAN 77 to C++ and accelerated on the
GPU using Cuda C.  I attached a paper that discusses such
implementation, acceleration and use cases.
