These notes are associated with the updates from version 3.4 to 3.6.

The major updates in IFISS 3.4 were:
o new function install_ifiss (to supplement helpme)
o new function newchannel_domain 
  (extended outflow compared to channel_domain)
o inclusion of rsquare_domain and usquare_domain 
  (called in place of square_domain for convection-difusion test problems) 
o new symmetric step domain and functionality for solving associated 
  steady and unsteady flow problems (see symmetricstep.txt)


The significant updates in IFISS 3.5 were the addition of new 
functionality within the /timestepping/ directory:
o  updated driver function stabtrNS.m with the inclusion of an option 
   to perform nonlinear (Picard) iterations at every time step
o  new driver restart_stabtrNS to effect a warm restart from a 
   previously computed solution
o  new post-processing function (energymeanvorticity.m) that generates
   mean vorticity and acceleration data (to allow one to assess 
   convergence to a steady-state)  
o  enhanced post-processing of unsteady flow solution data: notably
   in the generation of (.avi) animations using the enhanced 
   video functionality built into recent releases of MATLAB.

The most significant update in IFISS 3.6 is the addition of 
the /biharmonic/ directory and functionality. 
Other changes include
o removal of the GMG functionality when solving Stokes and 
  N-S flow problems using it_solve
o removal of stabilised approximation (Q1-P0, Q1-Q1) when solving
  unsteady flow problems
o removal of shifted domain option when solving poisson control
  problems
o correction of the error estimation for steady Stokes and N-S
  (the functions q1div.m and q2div.m were originally coded incorrectly
  so Tables 3.4 and 3.5 and 8.1 in [ESW2014] are incorrect)
