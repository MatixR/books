*Simple one-dimensional examples of various hydrodynamics techniques*

This is a collection of simple python codes (+ a few Fortran ones)
that demonstrate some basic techniques used in hydrodynamics codes.
All the codes are *standalone* -- there are no interdependencies.

These codes go together with the lecture notes at:

http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/hydro_by_example/CompHydroTutorial.pdf

and with the pyro2 code:

* `advection/`

  - `advection.py`: a 1-d second-order linear advection solver with a
    wide range of limiters.

  - `fdadvect_implicit.py`: a 1-d first-order implicit
    finite-difference linear advection solver using periodic boundary
    conditions.

  - `fdadvect.py`: a 1-d first-order explicit finite-difference linear
    advection solver using upwinded differencing.

  - `fv_mol.py`: a 1-d method-of-lines second-order accurate advection
     solver.
     
  - `Fortran/`:

    * `advect.f90`: a Fortran implementation of second-order linear
	  advection.  This version does piecewise constant, piecewise
	  linear, and piecewise parabolic (PPM) reconstruction.
	  
* `basic-numerics`

  - `orbit-converge.py` (and `orbit.py`): a demonstration of the
    convergence of different ODE integration methods for the problem
	of Earth orbiting around the Sun.
	
* `burgers/`

  - `burgers.py`: a 1-d second-order solver for the inviscid Burgersâ€™
    equation, with initial conditions corresponding to a shock and a
    rarefaction.

* `compressible/`

  - `euler.ipynb`: a `SymPy` `IPython` notebook that derives the
    eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the Euler equations.

  - `riemann-phase.py`: a simple script that plots the Hugoniot curves
     for a compressible Riemann problem (assuming a gamma-law gas)

* `diffusion/`

  - `diffusion-explicit.py`: solve the constant-diffusivity diffusion
    equation explicitly. The method is first-order accurate in time,
    but second- order in space. A Gaussian profile is diffused--the
    analytic solution is also a Gaussian.

  - `diffusion-implicit.py`: solve the constant-diffusivity diffusion
    equation implicitly. Crank-Nicolson time-discretization is used,
    resulting in a second-order method. A Gaussian profile is
    diffused.

* `elliptic/`

  - `poisson_fft.py`: an FFT solver for a 2-d Poisson problem
    with periodic boundaries.

* `finite-volume/`

  - `conservative-interpolation.ipynb`: an IPython notebook that
    illustrates how to derive high-order conservative interpolants
	for finite-volume data.

* `incompressible/`

  - `project.py`: a simple example of using a projection to recover
    a divergence-free velocity field.

* `multigrid/`

  - `mg_converge.py`: a convergence test of the multigrid solver. A
    Poisson problem is solved at various resolutions and compared to
    the exact solution. This demonstrates second-order accuracy.

  - `mg_test.py`: a simple driver for the multigrid solver. This sets
    up and solves a Poisson problem and plots the behavior of the
    solution as a function of V-cycle number.

  - `multigrid.py`: a multigrid class for cell-centered data. This
    implements pure V-cycles. A square domain with 2 N zones (N a
    positive integer) is required.

  - `patch1d.py`: a class for 1-d cell-centered data that lives on a
    grid. This manages the data, handles boundary conditions, and
    provides routines for prolongation and restriction to other grids.

* `multiphysics/`

  - `burgersvisc.py`: solve the viscous Burgers equation. The
    advective terms are treated explicitly with a second-order
    accurate method. The diffusive term is solved using an implicit
    Crank-Nicolson discretiza- tion. The overall coupling is
    second-order accurate.

  - `diffusion-reaction.py`: solve a diffusion-reaction equation that
    propagates a diffusive reacting front (flame). A simple reaction
    term is modeled. The diffusion is solved using a second-order
    Crank-Nicolson discretization. The reactions are evolved using the
    VODE ODE solver (via SciPy). The two processes are coupled
    together using Strang-splitting to be second-order accurate in
    time.

* `parallel/`

  - `relax-mpi.f90`: a simple example of pure relaxiation using
    domain decomposition + message passing (through MPI) to
	implement smoothing in a parallel fashion.

  - `relax-omp.f90`: a simple example of pure relaxation using
    OpenMP to parallelize the loops using shared-memory.
