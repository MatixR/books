      There are three script files (programs) mtc.m (method of 
characteristics), shocks.m, and cl.m.  The remainder of the files
are function mfiles. 

      Program mtc uses function mfiles f1.m, f2.m,f3., and f4.m for 
initial data.
      Program shocks uses function mfiles f1.m, f2.m.
      Program cl uses function mfiles f1.m, f2.m, f5.m, f6.m, and f7.m.
      Program cl also uses function mfile flux.m as the flux function.
