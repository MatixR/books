     heat1 solves the initial value problem for the heat equation on the
whole line, no boundary condtions. One initial condition is "built in"
to the program heat1. Other initial conditions must be provided in a
function mfile ff.m, or an inline function ff.

     heat2 solves an initial value problem for the heat equation on the
half line with either the homogeneous dirichlet or neumann condition at
x = 0.  The initial data is a piecewise constant constant function 
contained in heat2.m.
