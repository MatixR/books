     There are 3 script files (programs) heat3.m, heat4.m, and heat5.m

     heat3 integrates the heat equation on [0, 10] with Dirichlet
boundary conditions. heatf.m is the function mfile of the initial data.
right.m and left.m are function mfiles which give the data at x = 0
and at x = 10 for the inhomogeneous boundary conditions.

     heat4 integrates the heat equation on [0,10] with homogeneous
Neumann boundary conditions. heatf.m is again the initial data. q.m is
the source function (right hand side) for this program.

     heat5 solves the heat equation on [0,10] with different diffusion
constants on [0,5] and [5,10]. heatf.m is again the initial data.

     u1.m is a function file for the first term in the eigenfunction
expansion of the solution of exercise 6), section 4.2, L = 10, and k = 1.
