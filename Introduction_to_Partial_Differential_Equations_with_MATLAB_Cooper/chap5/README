     F.m  and G.m are function mfiles to be used as wave profiles.

     program robin.m calculates the reflection of the incident wave
     profile G.m from the left boundary x = 0 with the Robin boundary
     condition.

     programs trans.m  calculates the reflection and transmission 
     of an incident wave wave profile, given by G.m.
    
     
     program wave1.m integrates the linear wave equation on [0,10]
     with u = 0 at x = 0 and x = 10.  The function files f.m and 
     g.m are the initial data.

     wave2 is a subdirectory which contains the files 

           wave2.m   f.m   g.m   newton.m   l.m    dl.m

     wave2.m integrates a nonlinear wave equation on [0,10] with u = 0
     at x = 0 and at x = 10. Initial data is given in f.m and g.m.
     wave2.m calls on the script file newton.m to advance each time
     time step by solving a nonlinear system. l.m and dl.m are function
     mfiles used by newton.m .

     program film_reflect is a script file which makes a 40 frame movie
     of the reflection of the incident wave profile, given in G.m, 
     with boundary condition u = 0 at the left boundary x = 0.
