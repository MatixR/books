     Program fseries.m  sums the Fourier series for several different functions,
     and uses the function files g.m and h.m.

     Program dft.m uses the fft to compute the DFT approximations to the
     real Fourier coefficients A_n and B_n. It further adds up the
     partial sums and the partial sum can be plotted. Uses the
     function mfile f.m

     The subdirectory transform contains the script mfile ftrans.m
     and the function mfile f.m.  ftrans.m uses the fft of Matlab
     to compute the Fourier transform of the function given in the
     mfile f.m
