     oscillatory is a subdirectory containing the files
          osc.m   intgnd1  intgnd2  

           osc.m is a program which evaluates an oscillatory integral
           with the integrand intgnd1

     dispersion is a subdirectory containing the files
           disper.m   bigu.m  omega1.m   omega2.m   omega3.m

           disper.m is a program which calculates dispersive waves. It 
           uses the functions mfiles bigu.m, omega1.m, 

           The Fourier transform of the initial data is given in bigu.m.
           Three different dispersion relations are given in the functon
           mfiles omega1.m, omega2.m, and omega3.m.

     schrodinger is a subdirectory containing the files
           unifm.m    shd.m   f.m    G.m

           unifm.m  is a program which uses simple Riemann sums to 
           calculate the solution of the free Schrodinger equation
           with initial data a uniform probability density on [-1, 1].
           It uses the function mfile G.m for the Schrodinger kernel.

           shd.m  is a program to calculate the solution of the free
           Schrodinger equation using fast fourier transform. It uses
           the function file f.m for the initial data.

     sqwell (square well)  is a subdirectory containing the files
           bdstates.m   pp.m   qq.m
      
           bdstates.m finds the eigenvalues and plots the eigenfunctions
           for the Schrodinger equation with a square well potential.
           It uses the function files pp.m and qq.m to find the eigenvalues.
