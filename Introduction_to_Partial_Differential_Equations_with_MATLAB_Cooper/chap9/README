       deflect.m  is a  program which solves the Poisson equation in
       the unit disk with zero boundary condition for special loads. It
       uses the function mfile  green.m .

       green.m  is a function mfile for the Green's function in the 
       unit disk. 

       dirch.m  is a program which solves the Dirichlet problem in the
       unit disk using Fourier expansions of the boundary data. User
       must provide a function mfile g.m for the boundary data.

            mvp.m is a program which finds the average about a circle of
            a function of two variables and compares it with the value of the
            function at the center of the circle.  It uses the three functions
            in the function mfiles u.m, v.m and w.m.
