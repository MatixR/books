# Approximate Riemann Solvers
This repo is my personal collection of finite difference (FD) and finite volume (FV) Riemann solvers using MUSCL and WENO schemes. These solvers are written as short Matlab scripts and they are now publicly available as I've moved to another field of CFD. All references can be found as comments inside the scripts. Any feed back on these snippets is always welcome. Happy coding!
